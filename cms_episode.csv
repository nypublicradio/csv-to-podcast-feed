<p>Hear excerpts from Pulitzer Prize-winning American composer John Luther Adams&rsquo; work,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Sila: Breath of the World,</em>&nbsp;a work consisting of five discreet pieces played by five different groups, designed to be stacked, perhaps outdoors, in a grand landscape &ndash; like that of the concourse between Juilliard and the Performing Arts Library at Lincoln Center, perhaps as happened at the 2014 premiere - and will sound different each time it is played due to the surroundings. The title of the piece,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Sila,&nbsp;</em>is an Inuit word that means &ldquo;forces of nature&rdquo;, but also &ldquo;the spirit / consciousness behind nature&rdquo;. The performers in this recording are JACK Quartet, The Crossing choir, and percussionists and musicians from the University of Michigan, conducted by Doug Perkins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also listen to American composer Viet Cuong&rsquo;s percussion concerto quartet, &ldquo;Re(new)al&nbsp;&ldquo; for Sandbox Percussion, which opens with tuned toasting patterns. Each member of Sandbox holds two crystal glasses each and clinks, like a &ldquo;cheers&rdquo; before moving on to compressed air cans and more traditional percussion of snare drum and vibraphone. Then, there&rsquo;s music by American composer Robert Moran, where the conductor leads the orchestra from within a circle, with practically all of the piece played as softly as the musicians can be.</p>

<p>The California Honeydrops got their start as a duo busking on the streets of Oakland, but now they&rsquo;re a quintet headlining major concert spots. They play everything from soul and R&amp;B to New Orleans second-line music to ska to blues. Even their name, The California Honeydrops, sounds like an old-time American string band. So it&rsquo;s a little surprising to learn that the band&rsquo;s lead singer, guitarist and trumpeter is originally from Poland. But Bonnie Raitt thought enough of their rootsy Americana sound to sing with them on one of their albums. The California Honeydrops play Oct. 25 at Webster Hall.&nbsp;</p>

And in November he will reissue Klark Kent, his first solo album, originally released in 1980. Copeland joins us to talk about his career and take calls.</p>

<p>Listen to music for trumpet played in water and prepared piano from avant-garde, trumpeter, composer and bandleader Steph Richards with pianist Joshua White. Conceptualized while breathing for two, Richards plays on the idea that her in utero child was, in a sense, breathing underwater. Then, listen to music for prepared piano and clarinet by Kathleen Tagg and David Krakauer, which aim to evoke the single-string percussion instrument, berimbau.</p>
<p>Then, hear music for prepared kantele, the traditional Finnish table-harp, by Pauliina Syrj&auml;l&auml; using a few untraditional methods. She strikes it like a hammered dulcimer and sometimes uses knitting stick [needle] and paintbrush. And more.</p>

<p>Hear a work by California composer, violinist, and climber, Andrew McIntosh inspired by mountains&nbsp;- more specifically a backpackers&rsquo; camp called Little Jimmy, located in the San Gabriel Mountains. The work is in six parts, and was written for the two pianos, two percussionists of Yarn/Wire, and includes field recordings made at the camp.</p>
<p>The piece was conceived of in a tactile and sustained way, with bowing and rapid manipulation of percussion instruments, which can create some volatile overtones. Yet, as McIntosh observed, there are no bass notes, and the field recordings are woven into the piece in movements 2 and 6, which can sometimes merge with the surroundings, depending on whether the piece is performed indoors or outdoors. Hear pianists Conor Hanick and Matthew Aucoin, and percussionists Jonny Allen and Mari Yoshinaga play the work, recorded at Ojai Music Festival&rsquo;s Libbey Bowl.</p>
<p>Also, hear selections from a program of songs, performed by bass-baritone&nbsp;Dav&oacute;ne Tines, which included songs of drummer/composer Tyshawn Sorey and American composer Margaret Bonds, along with parts of violinist/composer Caroline Shaw&rsquo;s<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Mass</em>.</p>
<p><span>This is Part&nbsp;2 of a four-part series for 2022. The performances and interview were recorded at the 2022 Ojai Music Festival.&nbsp; -</span><em>Caryn Havlik</em></p>

<p>New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission will no longer limit the number of new licenses for for-hire vehicles on the road, but there's one important caveat: new cars must be electric or wheelchair accessible. <strong>Evan Simko-Bednarski</strong>, transit reporter at the <em>New York Daily News</em>, unpacks the new rule and its implications as congestion pricing looms.</p>

<li><strong>Aziz Huq</strong>, professor of law at the University of Chicago Law School, explains what a gag order is, and discusses the gag orders different judges have placed former President Trump under as he faces multiple trials.</li>

<p>Two singular composers tell the tale of a fiddler&rsquo;s Faustian bargain and musical duel with the devil. The suite from&nbsp;<em>The Soldier&rsquo;s Tale</em>&nbsp;is one of Stravinsky&rsquo;s most memorable chamber works, retaining the stylistic range, dance elements, and expert instrumentation of his larger-scale compositions.

<p><span>We&rsquo;ll start our European tour in Estonia. Hear two pieces from the late Estonian composer Veljo Tormis, who was known for writing choral settings of his home country&rsquo;s traditional folk songs. The Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir performs his pieces &ldquo;The Swing Asks For Gifts&rdquo; from </span><em><span>Swing Songs</span></em><span> and &ldquo;Wee Winky Mouse&rdquo;. Then, you&rsquo;ll hear a piece inspired by Tormis from another Estonian composer, T&otilde;nu K&otilde;rvits. His work, &ldquo;Peegeldused tasasest maast&rdquo; (Reflections from a Plain) features Anja Lechner on solo cello and himself on the Finnish and Estonian table harp known as the Kantele. Plus, there&rsquo;s more of the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir in a piece by Swiss violinist, Paul Giger. His &ldquo;O Ignis&rdquo; is an arrangement of a piece by Hildegarde von Bingen, the German abbess and composer from the middle ages.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, we&rsquo;ll travel south to Bulgaria for a selection from the 1975 album, Le Myst&egrave;re des Voix Bulgares (The Mystery of the Bulgarian Voices). The Bulgarian Women&rsquo;s Choir sings &ldquo;Kalimankou Denkou&rdquo;, which translates to ""The Evening Gathering&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ll hear the chorus gather around soloist Yanka Rupkina.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We&rsquo;ll take a trip to the north of the Iberian Peninsula with </span><em><span>Path of Miracles</span></em><span> by Joby Talbot. Commissioned by London-based vocal ensemble, Tenebrae, this piece was inspired by the famous Catholic pilgrimage route, the Camino Frances, and each movement was recorded in a church along the route.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We&rsquo;ll make a quick stop in the British Isles to hear The Choir of King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge perform </span><em><span>Pace </span></em><span>by Errollyn Wallen. Wallen writes that this piece can be heard as &ldquo;a single human breath; as a single line; as a world&rsquo;s long, long journey to light.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Plus, an extra choral treat from Canada. Jeremy Dutcher is a Canadian Indigenous musician and composer. In his piece &ldquo;Sakom&rdquo; he gathers a 12-voice ensemble of friends to sing in the Wolastoqey language. - </span><em><span>Laura Boyman</span></em></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s new music from composer, arranger, and bass player Devin Hoff which reimagines songs by Anne Briggs, a songwriter and amateur musicologist on the 1960&rsquo;s English folk scene who revived traditional English, Scottish, and Irish Traveler songs. Devin Hoff works with singers Julia Holter, Emmett Kelly, oud player Alejandro Farha, and drummer Jim White to recast these songs as a sometime &ldquo;doomy quartet of basses,&rdquo; with Holter&rsquo;s voice on top, a different song with unpretentious bass as support for Kelly&rsquo;s baritone, melodic Arabic modes on the tune anchored by the oud, and a bass-led mournful trio on another.</p>
<p>Then listen to thoughtful and spacious instrumental electric &ldquo;roots guitar&rdquo; from Laurel Premo, a Michigander who plays fiddle, clawhammer banjo, and guitar. Informed by these American traditional instruments, the music is a mix of &ldquo;glowing, droning, tugging, scraping, revolving,&rdquo; and could be described as &ldquo;electric dirt, the golden loam layered by centuries of folk&rdquo; [Bandcamp liner notes.] One of the tunes, &ldquo;Hop High,&rdquo; uses the percussive dancing talents of Nic Gareiss (of Michigan) in addition to Laurel Premo&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Also, hear music from fiddler, singer, banjo player and scholar Jake Blount, who has extensively researched Black and Indigenous mountain music, in a work from his record,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Spider Tales</em>.&nbsp;Then, listen to work by Irish composer Dave Flynn, as performed by the IMO Quartet, who are skilled traditional musicians in addition to accomplished classical players, together with Dublin-based piper Mick&nbsp;O'Brien.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s music from the trio Briars of North America (Vermont, Upstate NY, and Mexico City) who combine chamber music precision, the emotional transparency of folk, and the weight of ritual (<a href=""https://briarsofnorthamerica.bandcamp.com/"">Bandcamp bio</a>).

<p>Listen to new music by Belgian violinist, violist, composer and actress Catherine Graindorge. In her 21<sup>st</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>century chamber music, she uses a classical-looking string ensemble with harmonium and electronic treatments on her record,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Eldorado.</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Listen to &ldquo;Rosalie,&rdquo; a work that is both a celebration and a remembrance of a friend of her father. Then, listen to music by Odalie, the recording moniker of French composer Sophie Griffon, from her 2021 EP<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Derri&egrave;re l'&eacute;cran</em><span>&nbsp;</span>(""behind the screen"")&nbsp;where cello, synthesizer and sound manipulation are blended to create a highly textured electronic music. There&rsquo;s also music by Norwegian bassist, composer and producer&nbsp;Jo Berger Myhre (of doom jazz trio Splashgirl), whose sonic landscapes are exactly as promised from his latest record,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Unheimlich Manoeuvre</em><span>&nbsp;</span>- the English translation of&nbsp;<em>unheimlich&nbsp;</em>is &ldquo;uncanny&rdquo; or &ldquo;eerie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the French chamber group Snowdrops (Mathieu Gabry and Christine Ott), listen to a mixture of piano, strings, mellotron, electronics and the Ondes Martenot. Then, hear highly processed and manipulated piano by Moscow-based composer and multi-instrumentalist Dmitry Evgrafov, from his 2017 record,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Comprehension of Light</em>. Listen to even more post-classical music from German-born British&nbsp;composer/pianist Max Richter from his latest,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Exiles</em>, along with music from Berlin-based composer Nils Frahm, and the late Icelandic composer J&oacute;hann J&oacute;hannsson.</p>

Tines, a member of AMOC, is a path-breaking artist whose work blends opera, art song, contemporary classical music, spirituals, gospel, and songs of protest; he is also a co-creator and co-librettist of music films and music theater experiences.</p>
<p>Julius Eastman was a singer, pianist, and composer on the so-called downtown music scene in New York in the 1970s, both on his own and as a collaborator with artists like vocalist/choreographer/composer Meredith Monk and the late experimental American cellist Arthur Russell. Eastman was young, gay, and Black at a time when it was even more difficult to be young, gay, and Black"" (New Amsterdam Records&nbsp;<a href=""https://wildup.bandcamp.com/album/julius-eastman-vol-1-femenine"">Bandcamp liner notes</a>).</p>
<p>Dav&oacute;ne Tines and host John Schaefer discuss Julius Eastman&rsquo;s work, Tines&rsquo; connection to Eastman&rsquo;s lineage, and how the program Tines and AMOC prepared honors Eastman as a complete human, exploring the breadth and depth of his life and influence. Listen to Eastman&rsquo;s extraordinary piece<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Buddha,</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his ecstatic<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Gay Guerilla</em>, and the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Prelude to the Holy Presence of Joan of Arc</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for which Tines had to research and create a score, as Eastman did not leave a lot of written notation when he died in 1990.</p>
<p>This is Part 1 of a four-part series for 2022. The performances and interview were recorded at the 2022 Ojai Music Festival.&nbsp; -<em>Caryn Havlik</em></p>

The record is a dystopian take on AfroFuturism, and what the sounds of Black Spirituals might sound like after a climate catastrophe.

<p>There&rsquo;s also new music from Haitian-American musician&nbsp;Leyla McCalla and her work,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Breaking The Thermometer</em>, a music theater piece, commissioned by Duke University, which combines archival clips from Radio Haiti with new arrangements of traditional Haitian music.

<p>Then, listen to music from 2022 Polaris Prize-winning artist Pierre Kwenders, a Congolese-Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois musician, who combines Congolese soukous and rumba, futuristic soundscapes, and horn lines. Plus, a futuristic internet opera by sound artists Mendi &amp; Keith Obadike,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>The Sour Thunder</em>, containing two simultaneous stories; Mendi tracing the slave trade through the Dominican Republic, and that of a state called Solaika Dast, where scent is the method of communication.
